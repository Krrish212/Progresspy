## Backend

### Garmin API Data Collection

#### Importing FIT Files

1. Users must import their FIT activity files from their device, by connecting over Bluetooth or wired connection on their desktop, and using the following URL https://connect.garmin.com/. Instructions are clear after registering on how to import files.
2. Move them to the following folder (~ denotes root of the project) "~/Backend/DataCollection/FITActivity".
3. These can then be processed by garmin_collection_server.py - checking for when new files are entered.
**(LATER BUT MORE DIFFICULT PROCESS TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THIS WITH ANOTHER API SERVICE SUCH THAT THE USER ONLY HAS TO INTERACT WITH THE UI)**
